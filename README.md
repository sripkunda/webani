# Webani 

Webani is a TypeScript library for imperatively constructing interactive 2D/3D applications. The aim of the project is to provide the accessibility of animation libraries like Manim alongside the versatility of a 3D game engine like Unity and Godot. 

Here are some of the key features:

- Real-time code-based animation
- A physically-based rendering pipeline
- LaTeX support, for people coming from libraries like Manim

## Getting Started 

Webani can be installed using npm:

Installing globally will allow you to use the Webani CLI to scaffold projects and build your animations using the Webani Runtime. 

To create a project, use 

`webani create [project-name]`

To build and run your application, use

`webani build`

## Development Roadmap

Here are some specific features that are currently in the works:
- Interactivity (i.e. a framework for listening to and responding to inputs)
- Light probes
- Cascaded shadow maps
- Volumetric lighting
- Animation for rigged meshes
- Real-time global illumination
